# Masarak — Phase 2 Complete Integration Map

## How to read this document

For every entity in the system, this map answers:
- **Purpose** — what the table stores
- **Relationships** — FK connections to other entities
- **Phase 2 changes** — what was added or modified
- **Auth resolution** — how a JWT maps to this entity's rows
- **Policy guard** — which `[Authorize]` policy protects the endpoints that touch it

---

## Authentication Identity Chain

```
JWT token
  └─► "userid" claim (= users.UserId)
        ├─► users                 (always)
        ├─► students  WHERE UserId = @userId   (role == Student)
        ├─► teachers  WHERE UserId = @userId   (role == Teacher)
        └─► parents   WHERE UserId = @userId   (role == Parent)
```

## Entity Analysis

---

### 1. Role
| | |
|---|---|
| **Table** | `roles` |
| **Purpose** | Lookup table: Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent |
| **Relationships** | 1:N → User |
| **Phase 2 changes** | None |
| **Auth resolution** | `Role.Name` is written into the JWT `"role"` and `ClaimTypes.Role` claims at token issuance |
| **Policy guard** | AdminOnly (CRUD) |

---

### 2. User ⭐ PRIMARY AUTH ENTITY
| | |
|---|---|
| **Table** | `users` |
| **Purpose** | Central identity — one row per person regardless of role |
| **Relationships** | N:1 → Role · 1:1 → Student · 1:1 → Teacher · 1:1 → Parent · 1:N → Notification · 1:N → Subscription · 1:N → RefreshToken |
| **Phase 2 changes** | `PasswordHash` widened 255→500 · `EmailConfirmed` added · `FailedLoginCount` added · `LockoutEnd` added · `RefreshTokens` navigation added |
| **Auth resolution** | The `"userid"` JWT claim = `UserId`. Every protected service resolves the caller via `db.Users.FindAsync(currentUserId)` |
| **Policy guard** | Owner-scoped: users manage their own account. AdminOnly for listing/deactivating others |

**Updated columns:**
```sql
PasswordHash     NVARCHAR(500)  -- was 255; PBKDF2 format: base64(salt):base64(hash)
EmailConfirmed   BIT DEFAULT 0  -- Phase 2 NEW
FailedLoginCount INT DEFAULT 0  -- Phase 2 NEW; persisted across restarts
LockoutEnd       DATETIME2 NULL -- Phase 2 NEW; null = not locked
```

| **Auth resolution** | `db.Students.FirstOrDefault(s => s.UserId == currentUserId)` |
| **Policy guard** | StudentOnly for self-service. AdminOrTeacher for management |

```csharp
// In any StudentController action:
var student = await _db.Students.FirstOrDefaultAsync(s => s.UserId == currentUserId);
if (student == null) return Forbid();
